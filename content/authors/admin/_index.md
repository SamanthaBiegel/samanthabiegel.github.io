I am in the first year of my PhD at ETH Zurich as a Doctoral Fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Environmental Science. I’m particularly interested in AI for scientific discovery, data-centric machine learning, as well as usability and trustworthiness of machine learning methods in sustainability applications. I am part of [DS3Lab](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/) led by [Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html) and the [Geocomputation and Earth Observation](https://stineb.netlify.app/) group led by Benjamin Stocker.
